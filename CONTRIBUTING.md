# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute! A few quick guidelines:

- Fork the repository and create a feature branch from `main`.
- Run the project locally and ensure linting and tests pass before opening a PR.
- Follow existing code style; run `npm run format` to auto-format code.
- Write tests for new functionality and run `npm run test`.
- Keep changes focused and open a descriptive PR.

If you're unsure about an API or design choice, open an issue first.
